This script scans all the 1981 stock symbols from the file EQUITY_L.csv and identifies the names of the stocks that are at the fresh 52-week breakout, shortlists the names of the stocks, and saves them in the new CSV file called 52_Week_Breakout.csv.

Doji11.py is also one of the many screeners. This script scans all the 1981 stock symbols from the file EQUITY_L.csv and identifies the names of the stocks that formed a minimum of one doji in the last 5 trading sessions, shortlists the names of the stocks, and saves them in the new CSV file called doji_candles_detection_results.csv. And saves the chart of them also in the new directory.
